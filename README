The purpose of this repository is to collect and store clinical testing data for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests authorized by the FDA in a way that is consistent and machine readable.

The list of tests is available here: [https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations)

This project could really benefit from the input of a medical professional that understands the biology and chemestry of these tests. It's one thing to pull out some reported numbers. It's entirely another to understand which numbers are relevant/irrelevant and put them in context.

## Data model(s)

Coming soon!
